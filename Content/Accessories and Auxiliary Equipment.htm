        <h1>Accessories and Auxiliary Equipment</h1>
        <p><b>Within Eurorack modular synthesis, the individual modules represent only a foundational element. Augmenting these modules with appropriate accessories and auxiliary devices is crucial for realizing the system's complete capabilities. These often-underestimated tools, ranging from basic patch cables facilitating signal flow to advanced mixers and interfaces enabling external integration, are fundamental for signal routing, processing, performance execution, and overall workflow efficiency. They effectively transform a set of individual modules into a unified and expressive musical instrument.</b>
