        <h1>Modules</h1>
        <p>Eurorack modules are individual components of a modular synthesizer system that conform to the Eurorack standard. Each module performs a specific function, such as generating sounds, shaping audio signals, or modulating other modules. By combining different modules, users can create a fully customizable and highly versatile synthesizer tailored to their preferences.</p>
